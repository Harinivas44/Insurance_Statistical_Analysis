# Overview
 Insurance Statistical Analysis project! This project explores a dataset related to insurance charges and various factors affecting them. We've conducted several statistical analyses to gain insights into the data.
## üìã Steps:

The primary objective of this project is to understand and analyze insurance-related data to identify trends and correlations. Here's what we've done:

* Data Exploration: We start by loading the dataset, which contains information about age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

* Data Summary: We provide a brief summary of the dataset's shape and data types, ensuring you have a clear picture of its structure.

* Distribution Analysis: We visualize the distributions of the 'BMI,' 'Age,' and 'Charges' columns, offering insights into the data's spread.

* Outlier Detection: We identify potential outliers in the 'BMI,' 'Age,' and 'Charges' columns using box plots.

* Categorical Data Analysis: We explore categorical columns such as 'Sex,' 'Children,' 'Smoker,' and 'Region' to understand their distributions.

* Correlation Analysis: We calculate correlations between numerical columns ('Age,' 'BMI,' 'Children,' 'Smoker,' 'Region,' and 'Charges') and present them using a heatmap. The strongest correlation is observed between smoking status and charges.

* Hypothesis Testing:

   * We test whether charges of smokers differ significantly from non-smokers.
   * We investigate whether the BMI of males differs significantly from that of females.
   * We analyze if the proportion of smokers significantly differs between genders.
   * We check if the distribution of BMI across women with varying numbers of children is the same.
## ‚≠ê Findings

* Charges are significantly different for smokers and non-smokers.
* Gender does not have a significant effect on BMI.
* Smoking habits are significantly different between genders.
* The number of children does not significantly affect BMI.
